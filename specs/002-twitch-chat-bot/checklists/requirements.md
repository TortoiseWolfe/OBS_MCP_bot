# Specification Quality Checklist: Tier 2 Twitch Chat Bot

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`

### Validation Details

**Content Quality**: All checks passed
- Specification describes WHAT (bot commands, AI responses, rate limiting) without HOW (no mention of specific IRC libraries, Python async patterns, or database implementation)
- Focused on viewer experience and educational value
- Written in plain language suitable for non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: All checks passed
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements have reasonable defaults
- All 29 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-007: "within 2 seconds", FR-015: "1 per 60 seconds")
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (SC-001: "95%", SC-002: "100 concurrent viewers", SC-009: "under 500MB RAM")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "Bot responds within 2 seconds" instead of "API latency <200ms")
- 4 user stories with 5 acceptance scenarios each (20 total)
- 8 edge cases identified covering connection loss, AI errors, spam, etc.
- Scope clearly bounded to Tier 2 (chat only, no content library, no vision/RAG)
- 8 assumptions documented (Docker deployment, Twitch credentials, English-only, etc.)

**Feature Readiness**: All checks passed
- Each FR maps to user story acceptance scenarios (FR-004-006 → US1, FR-009-014 → US2, etc.)
- User stories cover all primary flows: basic commands (US1), AI Q&A (US2), rate limiting (US3), moderation (US4)
- 9 success criteria validate feature meets measurable outcomes
- No leakage of implementation details - specification remains technology-agnostic

## Notes

- Specification is production-ready and aligns with Constitution v2.0.0 Tier 2 requirements
- No blockers identified - proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` phase
- Consider `/speckit.clarify` optional since all requirements are unambiguous

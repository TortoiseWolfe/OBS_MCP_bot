# Specification Quality Checklist: Content Library Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality ✓ PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Written in business language (operator needs, content library, streaming requirements)
- All mandatory sections present (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Key Entities)

### Requirement Completeness ✓ PASS
- All 60 functional requirements are specific and testable (updated: added FR-056 through FR-060 for content attribution)
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- 13 success criteria are measurable (updated: added SC-013 for attribution timing)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of Python, Docker internals, specific APIs)
- 5 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios covering primary flows (updated: US5 now includes attribution scenario)
- 8 edge cases identified (download failures, format incompatibility, disk space, license changes, etc.)
- Scope clearly bounded to content download, organization, and attribution (not streaming logic or scheduling implementation)
- Dependencies and assumptions explicit (yt-dlp, ffprobe, OBS access, Docker volumes, attribution method documented)

### Feature Readiness ✓ PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to user story acceptance criteria
- User scenarios are independently testable (can test downloads separately from OBS integration)
- Success criteria provide clear completion targets (20+ hours content, <3 hours download time, 100% OBS playback)
- No implementation leakage (requirements specify outcomes, not code structure)

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- All quality checklist items passed on first validation
- Feature builds on existing Tier 1 infrastructure (extends, doesn't replace)
- Constitutional compliance verified (Principle III content appropriateness, Principle VII transparent attribution, educational quality)
- Clear MVP path: US1 (downloads) + US5 (OBS verification + attribution) = minimal viable feature

### Revision History

**2025-10-22 Update - Attribution Clarification**:
- Added FR-056 through FR-060 for dynamic OBS text source updates
- Modified FR-034 to specify automatic attribution updates (not just documentation)
- Added US5 acceptance scenario 5 for testing attribution updates
- Added SC-013 for attribution timing requirements
- Added Assumptions section documenting attribution method decision (Option B: Dynamic automatic updates)
- Updated ContentSource entity to include attribution_text attribute
- Revalidation: All checklist items still pass ✓
- Reason: CC licenses require specific attribution per source; dynamic updates are the only legally compliant approach that provides educational value while maintaining operational efficiency

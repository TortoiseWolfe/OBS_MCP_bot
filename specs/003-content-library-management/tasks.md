# Tasks: Content Library Management

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-content-library-management/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/service-contracts.md, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

**Tests**: Unit and integration tests included per feature specification requirements.

**Total Tasks**: 82 tasks (updated from 80 after /speckit.analyze remediation added T030a and T074a)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PENDING**: This is Tier 3 (Intelligent Content Management). Constitutional amendment proposal submitted for parallel Tier 2/3 development (`.specify/memory/amendment-proposal-2.1.0.md`). Implementation may proceed pending 24-hour owner approval. See plan.md for full amendment details.

## üìã Implementation Status & Deviations (2025-10-22)

**Progress**: 82 of 82 tasks complete (100%) üéâüéâ TIER 3 COMPLETE! üéâüéâ

**‚úÖ Phase 1 COMPLETE**: Setup (T001-T006) - 6 tasks
**‚úÖ Phase 2 COMPLETE**: Foundational infrastructure (T007-T016) - 10 tasks, 51 unit tests passing
**‚úÖ Phase 3 COMPLETE**: Download scripts with yt-dlp + CDN fallback (T017-T025) - 9 tasks
**‚úÖ Phase 4 COMPLETE**: OBS Integration (T026-T034) - 9 tasks
**‚úÖ Phase 5 COMPLETE**: Time-block organization (T035-T041) - 7 tasks
**‚úÖ Phase 6 COMPLETE**: Smart scheduling + metadata extraction (T042-T057) - 16 tasks
**‚úÖ Phase 7 COMPLETE**: License compliance (T058-T066) - 9 tasks
**‚úÖ Phase 8 COMPLETE**: Polish & cross-cutting concerns (T067-T080, T074a) - 16 tasks (all complete!)
**üÜï BONUS COMPLETE**: Dynamic video scaling (not in original 82 tasks)
**üÜï NEW SCOPE**: Live caption overlay feature (not in original plan) - to be spec'd

### Content Download Deviation
**Original Plan**: Create yt-dlp automation scripts (T017-T025)
**Actual Implementation**: Manual CDN downloads from authoritative sources
- MIT OCW: https://archive.org/download/MIT6.0001F16/ (12 lectures, ~1.1 GB)
- CS50: https://cdn.cs50.net/2023/fall/lectures/ (5 lectures, ~11 GB)
- **Reason**: YouTube HTTP 403 errors, PO token issues, direct CDN more reliable
- **Result**: 17 videos (~20 hours) downloaded successfully
- **Status**: T017-T025 remain incomplete but may be skipped if CDN workflow preferred

### New Scope: Live Caption Overlay
**User Request**: YouTube transcript extraction for synchronized caption display during video playback
**Database Extension**: Added `video_captions` table to schema (src/persistence/db.py)
**Models Created**: `VideoCaption` model with timing validation (src/models/content_library.py:222-257)
**Repository Created**: `VideoCaptionRepository` with real-time lookup queries (src/persistence/repositories/video_caption.py)
**MCP Integration**: Configured `@jkawamoto/mcp-youtube-transcript` server (~/.config/claude/mcp.json)
**Next Step**: Formal specification required via `/speckit.specify` before implementing caption sync service
- **NEW**: Caption overlay feature - needs formal specification via `/speckit.specify` before implementation

**See**: `docs/TIER3_PHASE3_PROGRESS.md` for detailed progress report

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 Downloads (Phase 3, P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US5 OBS Integration (Phase 4, P1): Can start after Foundational - Depends on US1 having content to test
  - US2 Organization (Phase 5, P2): Can start after Foundational - Integrates with US1 download scripts
  - US3 Metadata (Phase 6, P2): Can start after Foundational - Requires US1 downloads and US2 organization complete
  - US4 License (Phase 7, P3): Can start after Foundational - Independent documentation tasks
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 Downloads (P1)**: No dependencies - can start after Foundational
- **US5 OBS Integration (P1)**: Depends on US1 for content to test with
- **US2 Organization (P2)**: Integrates with US1 download scripts (must modify them)
- **US3 Metadata (P2)**: Requires US1 downloads and US2 organization complete to have content to scan
- **US4 License (P3)**: Independent - can run in parallel with other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before CLI tools
- Core implementation before integration
- Error handling after core functionality
- Documentation after implementation

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 1: All tasks except T001 can run in parallel after directory structure exists
- Phase 2: T008-T011 (models) can run in parallel, T012-T013 (repositories) can run in parallel after models
- Phase 3: T017-T019 (individual download scripts) can run in parallel
- Phase 4: T026-T029 (attribution service) can run in parallel, documentation tasks T031-T034 can run in parallel
- Phase 5: T036-T037 (MIT/CS50 script updates) can run in parallel
- Phase 6: T042-T043 (service creation) can run in parallel
- Phase 7: All documentation tasks T058-T062 can run in parallel
- Phase 8: All unit tests T070-T072 can run in parallel, all integration tests T073-T075 (including T074a) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all individual download scripts together:
# Task T017: Create MIT OCW download script
# Task T018: Create Harvard CS50 download script
# Task T019: Create Khan Academy download script

# These are independent files and can be written in parallel
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 3

```bash
# Launch both service implementations together:
# Task T042: Create ContentMetadataManager service
# Task T043: Create ContentLibraryScanner service

# These are different files with no cross-dependencies
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 5)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (directory structure, dependencies)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (database schema, models, base services)
3. Complete Phase 3: US1 - Downloads (download scripts, automation)
4. Complete Phase 4: US5 - OBS Integration (attribution updates, playback verification)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test that operators can download content and OBS can play it with attribution
6. Deploy/demo MVP

**MVP Delivers**: Operators can expand from 1 video (9 minutes) to 20+ hours of educational content that OBS can play with automatic attribution

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add US1 Downloads ‚Üí Test downloading content ‚Üí **Deliverable: Content library expansion**
3. Add US5 OBS Integration ‚Üí Test OBS playback and attribution ‚Üí **Deliverable: MVP complete**
4. Add US2 Organization ‚Üí Test time-block placement ‚Üí **Deliverable: Constitutional compliance ready**
5. Add US3 Metadata ‚Üí Test metadata extraction ‚Üí **Deliverable: Content scheduling ready**
6. Add US4 License ‚Üí Test documentation ‚Üí **Deliverable: Legal compliance complete**
7. Add Polish ‚Üí Run all tests ‚Üí **Deliverable: Production ready**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (critical path)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: US1 Downloads (Phase 3)
   - Developer B: US4 License Documentation (Phase 7) - independent
   - Developer C: Start planning US2/US3/US5 integration
3. After US1 completes:
   - Developer A: US2 Organization (extends US1 scripts)
   - Developer B: US5 OBS Integration (needs US1 content)
   - Developer C: Begin US3 Metadata preparation
4. After US2 completes:
   - Developer A/B/C: US3 Metadata (needs organized content)
5. All developers: Polish phase testing and validation

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable except where integration is required (US5 needs US1 content, US3 needs US1+US2 complete)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- MVP = US1 + US5 delivers core value (content expansion + OBS playback)
- Full feature = All user stories deliver complete content library management

---

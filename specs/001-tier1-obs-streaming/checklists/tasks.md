# Tasks Quality Checklist: Tier 1 OBS Streaming Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate implementation tasks completeness and quality before beginning development
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [tasks.md](../tasks.md)

## Format Compliance

- [x] All tasks use checkbox format `- [ ]`
- [x] All tasks have sequential IDs (T001-T110)
- [x] Parallelizable tasks marked with `[P]` (67/110 tasks)
- [x] User story tasks marked with story label ([US1], [US2], [US3], [US4])
- [x] All implementation tasks include file paths
- [x] No tasks missing required format components

## User Story Organization

- [x] Each user story has its own phase (US1=Phase 3, US2=Phase 4, US3=Phase 5, US4=Phase 6)
- [x] User stories ordered by priority (P1, P2, P3, P4 from spec.md)
- [x] Each user story phase includes story goal and independent test criteria
- [x] All user stories map to acceptance scenarios from spec.md
- [x] Tasks within each story follow logical order (models → services → integration)

## Independent Testability

- [x] US1 has independent test criteria (7-day uptime monitoring)
- [x] US2 has independent test criteria (owner source activation timing)
- [x] US3 has independent test criteria (simulated failure recovery)
- [x] US4 has independent test criteria (health API query validation)
- [x] Each story can be validated without others (except dependencies noted)

## Dependency Management

- [x] Phase dependencies clearly documented (Setup → Foundational → User Stories → Polish)
- [x] User story dependencies identified (US2/3/4 depend on US1)
- [x] Internal task dependencies documented within each phase
- [x] Dependency graph shows user story completion order
- [x] Parallel execution opportunities identified

- [x] SC-004 (zero dead air >5 sec): US1 T038, US3 T064
- [x] SC-005 (failover <5 sec): US3 T064, T073
- [x] SC-006 (stream quality <1%): US4 T079, T083
- [x] SC-007 (content transitions <2 sec): US1 T038
- [x] SC-008 (uptime metrics accuracy): US4 T089
- [x] SC-009 (owner interrupt 5x/day): US2 T056-T058

## Contract Coverage

- [x] All health API endpoints from contracts/health-api.yaml have implementation tasks
- [x] GET /health: US4 T086
- [x] GET /health/metrics: US4 T087
- [x] GET /health/uptime: US4 T088
- [x] Contract tests included (US4 T094-T096)

## MVP Definition

- [x] MVP scope clearly defined (Phase 1 + 2 + 3 = US1 only)
- [x] MVP task count specified (44 tasks)
- [x] MVP deliverable described (24/7 streaming with auto-start)
- [x] MVP value articulated (Constitutional Principle I satisfied)
- [x] MVP can be deployed independently

## Implementation Strategy

- [x] Recommended sprint plan provided (4 sprints)
- [x] Parallel development opportunities documented
- [x] Team coordination points identified
- [x] Alternative parallel strategy provided

## Completeness

- [x] Setup phase includes all infrastructure (requirements, Docker, config, logging)
- [x] Foundational phase includes all shared components (DB, models, OBS connection)
- [x] Each user story phase includes all needed components (models, services, tests)
- [x] Polish phase includes cross-cutting concerns (logging, error handling, docs)
- [x] Integration tests included for each user story
- [x] No functional requirements left unmapped to tasks

## Task Granularity

- [x] Tasks are specific enough for LLM execution (file paths, clear actions)
- [x] No tasks are too large (>1 file or >1 service method)
- [x] No tasks are too small (each has clear deliverable)
- [x] Tasks can be completed in 1-4 hours each
- [x] Complex tasks broken into subtasks (e.g., pre-flight validation split into T028-T030)

## Constitutional Alignment

- [x] Tier 1 scope maintained (no Tier 2/3/4 features in tasks)
- [x] Tasks implement Principle I (Broadcast Continuity): US1, US3
- [x] Tasks implement Principle IV (Owner Responsiveness): US2
- [x] Tasks implement Principle V (System Reliability): US1, US3, US4
- [x] No violations of constitutional tier discipline

## Documentation

- [x] README update task included (T101)
- [x] Config examples task included (T102)
- [x] Quickstart documentation tasks included (T108-T109)
- [x] Production deployment docs task included (T101, T110)

## Testing Strategy

- [x] Unit test structure defined but tests not explicitly required (per spec - no TDD mandate)
- [x] Integration tests included for each user story (T042-T044, T056-T058, T073-T076)
- [x] Contract tests included for health API (T094-T096)
- [x] End-to-end validation task included (T106-T107)

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All quality criteria met

**Task Count**: 110 tasks
- Setup: 12 tasks
- Foundational: 15 tasks
- US1 (MVP): 17 tasks
- US2: 14 tasks
- US3: 18 tasks
- US4: 20 tasks
- Polish: 14 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 67/110 tasks (61%)

**MVP Scope**: 44 tasks (Setup + Foundational + US1)

**Dependencies**: Clearly documented, enabling parallel development after MVP

**Format Compliance**: 100% - All tasks follow required checklist format with IDs, markers, and file paths

## Issues Identified

None - tasks.md is ready for implementation.

## Next Steps

✅ **Ready for Implementation** - Proceed to execute tasks in dependency order:
1. Phase 1 (Setup): T001-T012
2. Phase 2 (Foundational): T013-T027
3. Phase 3 (US1 - MVP): T028-T044
4. Deploy MVP and validate SC-001 (99.9% uptime over 7 days)
5. Phase 4-6 (US2/3/4): Can run in parallel after MVP
6. Phase 7 (Polish): Final production hardening

**Suggested first task**: T001 (Create project directory structure)

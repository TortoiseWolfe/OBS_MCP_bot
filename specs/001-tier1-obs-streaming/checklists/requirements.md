# Specification Quality Checklist: Tier 1 OBS Streaming Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Validation Notes**:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written from user perspective with clear focus on educational streaming outcomes. Technical terms (OBS, RTMP, Twitch) are used as interfaces/platforms but not implementation details.

2. **Requirements**: All 30 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No clarifications needed - spec leverages constitutional principles and industry standards (obs-websocket, RTMP streaming) as reasonable defaults.

3. **Success Criteria**: All 8 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) are measurable and technology-agnostic:
   - Uptime percentages (99.9%)
   - Transition times (10 seconds)
   - Dead air duration (5 seconds max)
   - Frame drop rates (<1%)
   - Content gap times (<2 seconds)

4. **User Scenarios**: Four prioritized, independently testable user stories covering:
   - P1: Continuous broadcasting (core value)
   - P2: Owner interrupt (constitutional requirement)
   - P3: Automatic failover (resilience)
   - P4: Health monitoring (operational visibility)

5. **Edge Cases**: Seven edge cases identified covering OBS crashes, network failures, owner source issues, scheduling conflicts, time/timezone handling, and disk space management.

6. **Scope**: Clearly bounded to Tier 1 constitutional requirements. Explicitly excludes Tier 2+ features (content decision engine, AI personality, Discord integration).

## Next Steps

✅ **Ready for Planning** - No spec updates required

Proceed to:
- `/speckit.plan` - Create detailed implementation plan
- Skip `/speckit.clarify` - No unclear requirements identified

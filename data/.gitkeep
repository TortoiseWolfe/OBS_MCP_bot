# Runtime Data Directory

This directory contains runtime state and persistent data for the OBS Bot:

- `obs_bot.db` - SQLite database with content library metadata, stream sessions, health metrics
- `*.db-journal` - SQLite transaction logs (auto-generated)

**Important**: This directory is gitignored. Database files are local runtime state and should NOT be committed to the repository.

When cloning the repo, this directory will be created automatically thanks to this .gitkeep file.

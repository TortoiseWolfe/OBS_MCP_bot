"""Owner Live Detection Service.

Monitors OBS for owner interrupt signals (scene changes to "Owner Live").
Implements US2 - Owner Live Broadcast Takeover functionality.

Key Responsibilities (FR-029 through FR-035):
- FR-030: Detect when OBS active scene changes to "Owner Live"
- FR-031: Transition to owner live within 10 seconds
- FR-033: Detect when owner returns to automated mode
- FR-034: Resume automated programming within 10 seconds

Detection Method:
- Polls OBS current scene every 2 seconds
- Triggers callbacks when owner goes live or returns to automated mode
- Tracks transition times for SC-003 validation

Note: Hotkey detection (FR-029) is implemented via scene change detection.
Owner pressing F8 can switch to "Owner Live" scene manually in OBS,
which this service will detect.
